<h1>TikTok Cleric Accused of Sexual Harassment in London Apartment</h1>
<div class="byline">By Sarah Whitmore, Crime Correspondent</div>

<p>London â€” Fuad Baddoza, a popular TikTok cleric originally from Kenya, has been accused of sexual harassment by a Sudanese woman in an incident that allegedly took place at his London apartment earlier this month. According to police sources, the woman filed a complaint stating that Mr. Baddoza allegedly forced himself on her inappropriately without her consent after inviting her to his residence in North London.</p>

<p>The alleged victim, whose identity has been withheld for legal reasons, claims that she had trusted Mr. Baddoza due to his public persona as a religious figure and influencer.</p>

<p>Mr. Baddoza has categorically denied the charges, insisting that the woman came to his apartment of her own accord and for her own personal reasons. In a brief statement outside the courthouse, he said, <span class="quote">"I am innocent of these allegations. I have full faith that the truth will prevail."</span></p>

<p>Following his arrest, Mr. Baddoza was granted bail under strict conditions, including the surrender of his passport and a prohibition against contacting the alleged victim. Authorities have advised Mr. Baddoza to retain legal counsel in preparation for the upcoming trial, expected to begin later this year.</p>

<p>The Metropolitan Police have taken into custody his private mobile phone data under the Public Safety Act, including phone conversations and his laptop. An officer speaking under anonymity said that the data is questionable and contains private activities, including conversations with the complainant woman, which may weaken the defense of Mr. Baddoza.</p>

<p>Mr. Baddoza was also taken into custody in 2020 with a complaint of a similar nature but was released after the charges were dropped by the complainant.</p>

<p>The case has sparked widespread attention on social media, where Mr. Baddoza has amassed hundreds of thousands of followers. Many of his supporters have expressed shock at the allegations, while critics have called for a thorough investigation.</p>

<p>The Metropolitan Police stated that investigations are ongoing and urged anyone with relevant information to come forward.</p>
